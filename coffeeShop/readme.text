Project Description

Goal:

The goal of this project is to give hands on practical experience with building a Spring Boot Web Application and Web Services using the technologies we have been discussing during in class.

I’ve provided a base project for a Coffee Shop to bootstrap your work. You will need to install MySql in your computer or adjust the properties and dependencies of the project to use another database.

NOTE: In the resources/application.properties file, modify the properties for your database and run the application once (or do Maven Install for the test to execute the application). Then go comment out the line bellow, to avoid recreating the database every time it runs.

#Comment out the ddl-auto line after the first time you run the application
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create

 

Use the services provided to:

Create, List, Delete, Update products

Create, List, Update persons

Create and List orders

Your web application has to:

Provide a REST API to perform the operations above listed

A Java client application or web application to demonstrate/test how to consume your REST services

Provide a web application (if you use REST services to create your pages with JavaScript, do not implement this technique in more than 20% of your pages)

A public area, where visitors can see the list of products

Users can login to:

Place orders

Update their personal information (Users will be related to persons by email)

Administrators can login to:

Maintain the list of products

Create and List persons

List Orders

Add a page to allow visitors (in public) to register and become users that could login to place orders. You will need to add database tables and corresponding maintenance code to support this functionality, besides adjusting the authentication provider.
